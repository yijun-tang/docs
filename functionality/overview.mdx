## Two Main Windows

Selected has only two main windows designed to provide an intuitive experience and onboard new users effortlessly:

### Popup Window

Access the popup instantly with keyboard shortcuts:

- **macOS**: `Option + Space`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Space`

The popup window is your primary interface for interacting with Selected, appearing wherever you're working.

It consists of several key parts:

1. **Head bar** - Contains the following controls:

   - Model selection dropdown button
   - Chat pagination (only displayed when there are multiple pages)
   - New chat button
   - Pin window button
   - Chat history dropdown button

2. **Main display area** - The central workspace that shows:

   - Welcome message when no text is selected before hitting the shortcut
   - Selected text when text is selected or processed result

3. **Input box** - Your command center featuring:
   - Add files button to attach context (only supports plain text files for now)
   - Attachments (added via the Add files button or **Attachment** command)
   - Chosen commands (if any)
   - Custom prompt (if any)
   - Execute button (appears when execution conditions are met, which can be configured in the settings window)

You can close the popup window by pressing the `Esc` key or clicking outside of it.

### Settings Window

Open the settings window with:

- **macOS**: `Command + ,`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + ,`

The settings window allows you to customize Selected to match your preferences and workflow.

The General tab provides straightforward configuration options that are self-explanatory.

The Commands tab contains two parts: commands and variables. See more about how to customize built-in commands prompt or add custom commands on the [Custom Commands](/functionality/custom-commands) page.

## Design Principle

Selected's principle is to lower your cognitive load as much as possible. You only need to focus on the command concept for now. Each command corresponds to an optimized prompt (system prompt and user prompt), wiring together the selected text, attachments, and custom prompt. This approach is suitable for common writing tasks without sacrificing flexibility. It will be embodied in the following pages.
