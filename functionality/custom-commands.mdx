Selected allows you to customize commands in two ways:

1. **Customize built-in commands** - Modify the prompts of any of the customizable built-in commands with your own version to fulfill your specific needs. You can reset them to default at any time.
2. **Create custom commands** - Build entirely new commands for your daily tasks that aren't covered by the built-in commands.

## Command Structure

Each command consists of two key components:

- **System prompt** - Defines the overall behavior and role of the command
- **User prompt** - Specifies what to do with the input (selected text, attachments, custom prompt)

You can use variables in your prompts to reference:

- Selected text (`{{selectedText}}`)
- Attachment text (`{{attachmentText}}`)
- Custom input from the user (`{{inputtedText}}`)

## Example: Prompt Optimizer

Here's an example of a custom command that optimizes prompts for AI models:

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-xl"
    src="/images/custom-commands.png"
    alt="Custom Commands settings showing command customization interface"
  />
</Frame>

1. **Name:** Prompt Optimizer
2. **Icon:** Choose an icon that represents your command
3. **Conditions:**
   - Selected text: required
   - Attachment: ignored
   - Inputted text (Custom prompt): ignored
4. **System prompt:**
   ```

5. **User prompt:**
